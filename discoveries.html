          <p class="card-text">Two researchers unexpectedly discovered the largest-known comet to date.<br>

            Graduate student Pedro Bernardinelli was looking through Dark Energy Survey data to find objects that live beyond Neptune's orbit when he noticed an object significantly farther from the sun than the objects he planned to study. He asked his advisor, cosmologist Gary Bernstein, to have a look. <br>
            
            They had actually detected a comet that is much larger than any of the ones known so far to science: It may be 10 times wider and 1,000 times more massive than a typical comet.<br><br><br><br></p>

            Tiny black holes are hard to spot, but scientists managed to find this one when they noticed strange behavior from its companion star, a red giant. <p> Researchers observed its light shifting in intensity, which suggested to them that another object was tugging on the star. </p>
            
            This black hole is super-lightweight at just three solar masses. Its location in the constellation Monoceros and its rarity have inspired this black hole's name.</p> <br>

          <br>
          <p class="card-text">In July 2021, the novel project behind the world's first photo of a black hole published an image of a powerful jet blasting off from one of these supermassive objects. <br>

            The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a global collaboration of eight observatories that work together to create one Earth-sized telescope. The end result is a resolution that is 16 times sharper and an image that is 10 times more accurate than what was possible before. <br>
            Scientists used EHT's abilities to observe a powerful jet ejected by the supermassive black hole at the center of the Centaurus A galaxy, one of the brightest objects in the night sky.  </p>
